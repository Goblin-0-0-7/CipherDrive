YTDS:
add a loading bar ("x of y frames stiched")

save video as mp4 not avi

save frames with continious numbering so threads in ripper.unite is not needed

possible encryption ways:
read/write in 1==black and 1==white
scramble images
add images to public domane videos/images

performance:
decrypt in threads

ripper.unite -> less checks in loop

YTCS:
add mp4 to mp3 converter
