YTDS:
add 1. frame

put videos into folders
add folders and examples to gitignore

input diffentent settings
add a switch between video and picture en/decode

save video as mp4 not avi

save frames with continious numbering so threads in ripper.unite is not needed

possible encryption ways:
read/write in 1==black and 1==white
scramble images
add images to public domane videos/images

performance:
decrypt in threads

ripper.unite -> less checks in loop

BUGS:

extracting video streams takes to long
https://github.com/pytube/pytube/issues/1453
