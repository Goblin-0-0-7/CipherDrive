YTDS:
threading in encrypt not working?

save video as mp4 not avi

save frames with continious numbering so threads in ripper.unite is not needed

possible encryption ways:
read/write in 1==black and 1==white
scramble images
add images to public domane videos/images

performance:
decrypt in threads

ripper.unite -> less checks in loop

YTCS:
move all outputs to UI (Errormessages into Debuger, user-errors msg as pop up or simular)
merge to master if YTCS works normaly in UI

Error:
"QObject::setParent: Cannot set parent, new parent is in a different thread"
called in progress_funktion, when updating progressbar (maybe also in update_download_info)

BUGS YTCS:

extracting video streams takes to long
https://github.com/pytube/pytube/issues/1453

progress of video showing after "Download finished"

possible unchecked errors:
private video
age restriceted video
